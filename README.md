# E-Klase mail system wrapper

Something that I made because I was bored.

Use this as an example of how e-klase auth and mail api works.

Fun fact: you can get message body without marking it as 'read'

(maybe I will write more details about how it works or even make an additional repo for the whole eklase api)
